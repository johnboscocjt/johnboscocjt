## 👋 About Me
I am a **Computer Science enthusiast** who believes in understanding the *kernel* of things, not just the surface. I don't just build apps; I build understanding. 

My journey started on Windows, but necessity forced me into the arms of **Linux**. Now, I run a **Triple-OS Environment** (Ubuntu Mother + Kali & Windows VMs) to ensure I can code, hack, and compatibility-test on a non-high-end machine. 

I am transitioning from a **Jack of All Trades** to a **Master with a Plan**. 
*   **Past:** Web Development (Laravel/PHP).
*   **Present:** Mobile Development (React Native) + API Design.
*   **Future:** AI, Machine Learning, Cyber Security & **Agri-Tech Solutions**.

My goal? To elevate **Tanzania's tech status** in East Africa and the world, one commit at a time, while nurturing life through agriculture.

## 🧪 The Lab (System Setup)
*Optimizing low-end hardware for high-end performance.*

```bash
johnbosco@tanzania:~$ neofetch

OS: Ubuntu (Mother) 
VMs: Kali Linux (Security), Windows 10 (Compat)
Shell: Bash 5.0
Editor: VS Code / Vim
Mission: Ethical Hacking & Development
```

I enable my machine to operate **3 OSs simultaneously**. This allows me to develop securely, test ethically, and maintain compatibility without needing expensive hardware. **Resourcefulness > Resources.**

---

## ✝️ Faith & Foundation
*My strength and guidance beyond code.*

> **Jesus Christ** is my Lord and Savior, who helped channel this life in different views ever. He is the root of my resilience and creativity.

*   📖 **Philippians 4:13** - *"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."*
*   📖 **Romans 8:28** - *"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him."*

## 🎨 Creative Core & Life Passions
*Code is art, but so is life, nature, and growth.*

*   **🌱 Farming & Agriculture:** I have a deep love for tilling the soil and watching crops grow. I see parallels between nurturing a farm and nurturing a codebase—both require patience, planning, and care.
*   **🐄 Animal Keeping:** Raising and caring for animals is a joy. It teaches responsibility and connects me to the rhythms of life.
*   **🎵 Music Writing:** Composing beats and lyrics when the compiler needs a break.
*   **🎬 Videography & VFX:** Creating content and mobile VFX. I tell stories visually.
*   **📸 Photography:** Capturing the world through a lens.
*   **✍️ UI Design:** I design interfaces with **Pen & Paper** first. No Figma crutches. Just raw creativity on a special piece of paper.
*   **🕺 Dancing:** *Deprecated Module.* (Stopped professionally, but the rhythm helps my code flow).

## 🎓 Teaching & Community
> "I love teaching and breaking concepts of computer science to newbies and all people of age."

*   **Workflow Thief:** I love working with people to **steal their workflows** and optimize my own.
*   **Mentorship:** Breaking down complex CS topics for beginners.
*   **National Goal:** Making Tanzania a tech hub in East Africa.
